# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog -> in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress -> done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

# GIT BRANCH TRACKING
# ===================
current_branch: epic/6-ai-content-generation
base_branch: epic/5-campaign-builder

branch_strategy:
  # Branch naming convention:
  # - epic/{epic-number}-{epic-name}     → Branch do epic (ex: epic/1-mvp-prospecting)
  # - feature/{story-id}-{story-name}   → Branch da story (ex: feature/1.1-project-initialization)
  #
  # Workflow:
  # 1. Epic branch criada a partir da main (ou epic anterior)
  # 2. Feature branches criadas a partir do epic
  # 3. Ao finalizar story → merge na branch do epic
  # 4. Ao finalizar epic → PR para main
